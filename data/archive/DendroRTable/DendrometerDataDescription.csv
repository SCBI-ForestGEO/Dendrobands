R_column,description
measureID,"Arbitrary numeric identifier for measurements, not needed in analyses"
sp,"Six-letter species mnemonic, matching that used in main plot database"
quadrat,"Designation for 20x20 m quadrat, matching those used in main plot database"
gx,X-coordinate within full plot
gy,Y-coordinate within full plot
treeID,"Arbitrary numeric identifier for trees, identical to those used in the main plot database and useful for matching dendrometers to the plot data"
tag,"Tag number, appearing on aluminum tag attached to each tree; also matches dendrometer to plot data, though treeID is more secure"
stemID,"Arbitrary numeric identifier for stems, identical to those used in the main plot database and useful for matching dendrometers to the plot data"
stemtag,"Tag number, appearing on aluminum tag attached to each stem, matching plot database"
census,"Census number, starting with 1 for first-time dendrometer measurements then 2 etc. for remeasurements"
measure,"The principal dendrometer measurement of dendrometer, i.e. the gap between tips, spreading as the tree grows"
type,Dendrometer type
dir,Orientation of gauge dendrometer on trunk (a cardinal direction); O=oeste=west etc.
dendroID,"Arbitrary numeric identifier for dendrometer, crucial for identifying when dendrometers change within a stem"
dendHt,Height of dendrometer above ground
dendDiam,"Trunk diameter at the dendrometer, measured by a diameter tape, taken when dendrometer is first installed and necessary for converting subsequent dendrometer measures to dbh"
crown,Position of crown of tree: 1 (exposed) to 5 (shaded)
illum,Illumination of crown: 1 (high) to 4 (low)
lianas,Liana load in crown: 0 (none) to 5 (heavy)
exactdate,Date of dendrometer measure as Y-M-D
codes,Codes describing features of the trunk
status,Tree status: alive or dead
date,"Date as integer number of days since 1 Jan 1961, for easy calculation of time between measurements"
dbh,"Trunk diameter at dendrometer, = dendDiam on first measurement, subsequently estimated by converting dendrometer gap"

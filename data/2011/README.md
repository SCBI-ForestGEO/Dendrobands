# 2011 dendroband data

\# Surveys: 23

Biannual survey: 505 live trees

Intraanual survey: 105 live trees

In 2011 the dendroband survey took the form that has been used since. 

2011 is the first year for which we have intraannual data for the dendrobands. The file is much bigger than later years due to how often measurements were recorded. Although the protocol calls for biweekly measurements, 2011 had a mixture of the following:

- 2 measurements every week in May and early June
- 1 measurement every week in June, July, and early August
- 1 biweekly measurement in August, September, October, and November

For June-November, dendrobands were measured twice. The value in the csv file is taken from the archived excel sheet. Upon comparing the excel sheet measurement with the paper data, it is unclear why one measurement was used over another.

In the raw (Archive) data, the final survey (2011.23) dates were not fully updated in data entry. Dates were assigned to be 12/15/2011 unless otherwise mentioned in the "notes" field.

# 2011 dendroband data

2011 is the first year for which we have intraannual data for the dendrobands. The file is much bigger than later years due to how often measurements were recorded. Although the protocol calls for biweekly measurements, 2011 had a mixture of the following:

- 2 measurements every week in May and early June
- 1 measurement every week in June, July, and early August
- 1 biweekly measurement in August, September, October, and November

For June-November, dendrobands were measured twice. The value in the csv file is taken from the archived excel sheet. Upon comparing the two, it is impossible to tell why one measurement was used over another.

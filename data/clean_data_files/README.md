# README for data forms

Next steps:
- Headers of data pulled from Condit headers, added biannual and intraannual qualifiers

- approve the blank data forms
- write a script that will create a new sheet for each biannual census (one separate for March and November) pulling from the headers in the master_data.
- write a script that will also create the intraannual forms.
- right now we're saying that when surveyors find a measurement that varies by more than 3mm from the last survey, they should double check the measurement and indicate "double-checked" in the notes. We chose 3mm because it seemed like a good threshold. Did we want to re-calculate this number based on standard deviations of growth data over the past several years?

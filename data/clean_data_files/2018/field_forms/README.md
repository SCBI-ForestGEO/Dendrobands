# README for field forms

Whenever you’re printing a new sheet, please make sure the data from the old sheet has been entered already.

Codes for the field form should be followed by the census#, to help with data entry later.
-	For example, if the tree is broken on census# 2018.8, then the code is B8.
- Remember to record if there is a discrepancy between the current measurement and the last measurement (see metadata).


## Reminders for printing
1.	Remember to update the “Last reading” column with the most recent survey data.
2.	Filter by North or South (“N/S” column)

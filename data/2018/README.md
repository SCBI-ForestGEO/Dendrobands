# 2018 Data

\# Surveys:14

Biannual survey:523 live trees

Intraannual survey: 146 live trees

## Notes

The standardized format the data is in (with the field_forms, data_entry_forms, and subsequent Rscripts) was created in fall 2018, before and during the fall biannual survey. Surveys 2018.01 - 2018.12 were carried out in the original formats (see [archive](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/Dendrobands/tree/master/data/archive) folder), and copied into the new format later on.

The fall biannual survey is comprised of three different measurement types:
- Areas 3,4,7 were measured in mm to 0 decimal points (measured in cm in field)
- Areas 1,6,9 were measured in mm to 1 decimal point
- Areas 2,5,8 were measured in mm to 2 decimal points

All measurements should be in mm to 2 decimal points in keeping with previous years' methods.

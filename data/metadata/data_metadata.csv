1/A,tag,"Tag number, appearing on aluminum tag attached to each tree; also matches dendrometer to plot data, though treeID is more secure",numeric (integer),
2/B,stemtag,"Tag number, appearing on aluminum tag attached to each stem, matching plot database",numeric (integer),
3/C,survey.ID,"Survey number, of n measurements per year, written as ""YEAR.n"". For example, the March biannual survey in 2018 is labeled as 2018.01.

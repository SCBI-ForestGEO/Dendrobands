1/A,tag,"Tag number, appearing on aluminum tag attached to each tree; also matches dendrometer to plot data, though treeID and stemID is more secure",numeric (integer),
2/B,stemtag,Unique stem identifier from CTFS database. Useful for matching by stem. Some sites (e.g. SERC) use an aluminun tag at every individual stem.,numeric (integer),
3/C,survey.ID,"Survey number, of n measurements per year, written as ""YEAR.n"". For example, the March biannual survey in 2018 is labeled as 2018.01. The biweekly surveys after that are 2018.02, 2018.03, 2018.04, etc. The November biannual survey will be the highest number n, so in this example, it is 2018.14. For each year, any band replacements done before the spring biannual survey has an ID of XXXX.00, whereas any replacements after the fall survey get an ID of XXXX.99. If replacements are done between two intraannual surveys, they are given an ID of XXXX.XX1. For example, if 6 trees needed dendroband replacing, and they were replaced between surveys 2019.07 and 2019.08, they should get separate survey.ID rows of 2019.071.",numeric (double),

15/O,notes,"Notes from field, such as ""dendroband overextended"" ",character (string),

19/S,stemID,"Arbitrary numeric identifier for stems, identical to those used in the main plot database and useful for matching dendrometers to the plot data",numeric (integer),
20/T,treeID,"Arbitrary numeric identifier for trees, identical to those used in the main plot database and useful for matching dendrometers to the plot data",numeric (integer),
21/U,dendDiam,"Trunk diameter at the dendrometer, measured by a diameter tape, taken when dendrometer is first installed and necessary for converting subsequent dendrometer measures to dbh",numeric (double),mm
22/V,dbh,"Diameter at breast height, taken from most recent ForestGEO census. NOTE: In past, Condit script calculated this based on dendro bands.",numeric (double),mm
23/W,new.band,"Quantifier for if a band was replaced. ""0"" = no replacement, ""1"" = replacement. This should be noted on the particular survey.ID of replacement (see survey.ID description).",numeric (integer),
24/X,dendroID,"Arbitrary, unique numeric identifier for dendrometer, crucial for identifying when dendrometers change within a stem. When a dendroband is replaced or moved to a different POM (point of measurement), a new dendroID is given following in numerical order (across all years). This column contains the most recent dendroID number for the year. See dendroID_chronology.csv for previous dendroIDs.",numeric (integer),
25/Y,type,"Dendrometer type: 1 = plastic band, 2 = metal band",numeric (integer),
26/Z,dir,Orientation of gauge dendrometer on trunk (a cardinal direction); O=oeste=west etc.,numeric (integer),
27/AA,dendHt,Height of dendrometer above ground. Default location â€“ 10 cm above the main census measurement point.,numeric (double),m
28/AB,crown.condition,"Assessment of the crown condition, given as a number for crown health, and only measured in the FALL. The 4-point crown condition scale has the following categories:
4 = 75-100% of the crown is intact (no or few branches lost)
3 = 50-75% of the crown is intact
2 = 25-50% of the crown is intact
1 = 0-25% of the crown is intact (most of the crown is gone).

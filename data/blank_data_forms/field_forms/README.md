# README for field forms

If printing the first form for the season, please make sure the correct [R-script](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/Dendrobands/tree/master/data/clean_data_files/Rscripts) has been run from the master.

Codes for the field form should be followed by the census#, to help with data entry later.
-	For example, if the tree is broken on census# 2018.08, then the code is B8.
- Remember to record if there is a discrepancy between the current measurement and the last measurement (see metadata).


## Notes on printing new field_forms (after creating files from Rscripts)

1. delete the first row and first column

2. add all borders, merge and center title across top

3. adjust cell dimensions as needed

4. change print margins to "narrow"

5. make sure print area is defined as wanted ("Page Layout")

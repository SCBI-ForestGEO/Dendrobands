# 2013 Dendroband data

2013 is the first year where the number of dendrobands matches what we see in recent years. 50 more trees were added to the intraannual and biannual survey as part of a sap flow cluster study, bringing the total trees to 150 (intraannual) and 579 (biannual), including dead.

Removing dead trees, this amounts to 150 in intraannual and 566 trees in biannual.

All the new trees were added in the middle of the growing season, thus for these 50 trees, records only begin at survey 2013.06. The one exception is 30339 (three stems), which was the only new tree measured distinctly in 2013.01.

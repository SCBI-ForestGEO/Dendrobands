# 2013 Dendroband data

\# Surveys: 16

Biannual survey: 566 live trees

Intraannual survey: 150 live trees

2013 is the first year where the number of dendrobands matches what we see in recent years. 50 more trees were added to the intraannual and biannual survey as part of a sap flow cluster study, bringing the total trees to 155 (intraannual) and 579 (biannual), including dead. Because dead trees weren't removed from survey sheets until 2018, these numbers are the ones seen in the archive sheets for 2013- spring 2018.

All the new trees were added in the middle of the growing season, thus for these 50 trees, records only begin at survey 2013.06. The one exception is 30339 (three stems), which was the only new tree measured distinctly in 2013.01.

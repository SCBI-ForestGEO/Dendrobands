# Dendroband R Scripts

## analysis

This folder contains code for analyzing the data, for example looking at crown position, dbh distribution by species, ANPP, and growth over time.

## survey_forms

This folder has codes to create the forms used in biannual and intraannual surveys, plus forms used for replacing dendrobands and replacing dead trees.

## z_archive_2018

These are the codes used in 2018 to reformat the data into its current form. The scripts are not needed/useful anymore, however, they are kept here for the time being in case anyone needs to review the steps taken in reformatting.

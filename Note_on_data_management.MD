# Note on Data Management

Collection of these data is a collaboration between the Anderson-Teixeira and McShea labs. These data formerly lived on the McShea V: drive (V:/SIGEO/DENDROMETRY/Dendrobands), and are now managed in this GitHub repository by the Anderson-Teixeira lab. Access is provided to any McShea lab member via SCBI-ForestGEO-guest, the password for which is stored in the V: drive.

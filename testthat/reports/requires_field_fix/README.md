# Errors that require field fix (or manual review)

This folder contains the lists of trees with issues that cannot be automatically fixed. They require manual review and potentially going back to the field. However, some can be fixed without revisiting the tree; for example, tests for the "requires field fix?" field in [this table](testthat/README.md) is "sometimes" can often be resolved by reviewing other fields in the record. Moreover, a field surveyor may be able to remember a specific tree or know what type of error they must have made.

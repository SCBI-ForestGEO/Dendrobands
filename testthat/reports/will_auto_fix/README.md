# Errors that will be automatically fixed

This folder contains records of errors that can (and will) be automatically fixed by code and do not require field review. 

Warnings are generated to alert field surveyors that a record was coded incorrectly, in the hopes that this reduces repeat mistakes. These should be reviewed as a learning opportunity, and checked in the field/ manually fixed in case the auto fix seems inappropriate.

# Note about this repository's use of testthat

Unlike when you set up testthat so that all tests are run as part of an
R package R CMD CHECK, we set up `testthat.R` so that it is just another
R script to be run in a `.github/workflows/*.yml` file:

```
    steps:
      ...
      - name: Run tests
        run: Rscript testthat.R
```

Accordingly

* the contents and location of the `testthat.R` file
* the structure of the directory that contains all tests 

differ than that of a true R package repository, for example when
generated by `usethis::use_testthat()`. See `?testthat::test_check()` ->
"R CMD CHECK" section and this

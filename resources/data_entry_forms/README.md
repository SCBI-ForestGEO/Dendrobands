# Data entry forms

These forms are to be used to enter data from the field. They should then update the year's master file via R-scripts once the full data from each survey is entered.

The intent is that these will immediately be integrated into the master via script and then deleted. All information will be transferred to the master, and field data sheets (paper, or scans thereof) will serve as the raw field data reference.

## Entering Data

When entering biannual data, filter by ascending quadrat _first_, and then by area to match the [field form](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/Dendrobands/blob/master/resources/field_forms/field_form_biannual.xlsx)!

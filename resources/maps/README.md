# SCBI Dendroband Maps

The maps here contain plotted trees across the ForestGEO plot for the intraannual survey and the biannual survey. They should be updated at least once per year to account for any tree removals or additions for the survey.

These maps are meant to be helpful guides in the field for all surveys.

Numbered areas on the biannual map have been used as survey areas since 2012, as they were drawn by Gonzalez-Akre. In 2018 these were converted to a GIS map, and in the updated [biannual_field_form.xlsx](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/Dendrobands/blob/master/protocols_field-resources/field_forms/field_form_biannual.xlsx) as of Oct. 2018, these areas were coded to be a separate column by which surveyors can filter for easier data collecting.


## Editing

These maps were originally created with the geographic location data from this file in the V drive location below ("Merged_dendroband_utm_lat_lon.csv""), though now they are made from  [dendro_trees](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/Dendrobands/blob/master/data/clean_data_files/dendro_trees.csv).

The .mxd and associated shapefiles are located on the SI V drive: V:\SIGEO\GIS_data\dendroband surveys

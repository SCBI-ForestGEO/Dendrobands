# Protocols and Field Resources

## protocol

Sampling should follow the latest [ForestGEO dendrobands protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kCG22EAEnOVxw9Z-cPPvrHIzvRFE-j0U7anTmhJbkqM/edit). 

## maps

[Maps](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/Dendrobands/tree/master/resources/maps) of the biannual and intraannual dendroband trees in the SCBI plot are intended as guides for field measurements. They are generated using geographic/coordinate data from [dendro_trees](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/Dendrobands/blob/master/data/dendro_trees.csv).

## field_forms

Field forms are created from the master list via an R-script. These are created as .xlsx (excel) files to allow for retention of file manipulation for printing.

## raw_data

These forms are meant for office data entry, and are pulled from the year's [master file](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/Dendrobands/tree/master/data) via an R-script. This form is simplified to allow volunteers and those not familiar with dendroband survey methods to help enter data, if needed. Ideally, data should be entered directly after every survey, and merges (with the master data via scripts) should be run soon after the data has been entered into these forms.

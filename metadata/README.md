# README_metadata

The files here contain descriptions of the headers for the data files, including codes for field data entry.

tree_sp.csv includes the following information:

- what species of trees are present overall

- which of those trees are for the biannual survey, intraannual survey, or both

- which of these trees have been cored

- the local and global coordinates of these trees

- the UTM and lat/lon of each tree. These were obtained by merging this file with "scbi_stem_utm_lat_long.csv" found in V:\SIGEO\GIS_data\R-script_Convert local-global coord.

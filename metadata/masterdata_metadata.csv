1/A,record,Numbering of entered records,numeric (integer),
2/B,sp,"Six-letter species mnemonic, matching that used in main plot database",character (string),
3/C,quadrat,"Designation for 20x20 m quadrat, matching those used in main plot database",numeric (integer),
4/D,gx,X-coordinate within full plot,numeric (integer),m
5/E,gy,Y-coordinate within full plot,numeric (integer),m
6/F,treeID,"Arbitrary numeric identifier for trees, identical to those used in the main plot database and useful for matching dendrometers to the plot data",numeric (integer),
7/G,tag,"Tag number, appearing on aluminum tag attached to each tree; also matches dendrometer to plot data, though treeID is more secure",numeric (integer),
8/H,stemID,"Arbitrary numeric identifier for stems, identical to those used in the main plot database and useful for matching dendrometers to the plot data",numeric (integer),
9/I,stemtag,"Tag number, appearing on aluminum tag attached to each stem, matching plot database",numeric (integer),
10/J,census#,"Census number, of n measurements per year, written as ""YEAR.n"". For example, the March biannual survey in 2018 is labeled as 2018.1.

1/A,tag,"Tag number, appearing on aluminum tag attached to each tree; also matches dendrometer to plot data, though treeID is more secure",numeric (integer),
2/B,stemtag,"Tag number, appearing on aluminum tag attached to each stem, matching plot database",numeric (integer),
3/C,survey.ID,"Survey number, of n measurements per year, written as ""YEAR.n"". For example, the March biannual survey in 2018 is labeled as 2018.01. The biweekly surveys after that are 2018.02, 2018.03, 2018.04, etc. The November biannual survey will be the highest number n, so in this example, it is 2018.14. In addition, if band replacements are done outside of a normal survey, that measurement should be given a separate survey number. For example, if 6 trees needed dendroband replacing, and they were replaced between surveys 2019.07 and 2019.08, they should get separate entries in the master with a survey.ID of 2019.071.",numeric (double),
4/D,exactdate,Date of dendrometer measure as Y-M-D,numeric (double),
5/E,biannual,"Quantifier if tree belongs to biannual survey. Enter ""1"" if part of biannual survey, ""0"" if not.",numeric (integer),

11/K,measure,"The principal dendrometer measurement of dendrometer, i.e. the gap between tips (the window), spreading as the tree grows",numeric (double),mm
12/L,codes,Codes describing the tree. Explained in codes_metadata.csv,character (string),
13/M,notes,"Notes from field, such as ""dendroband overextended,"" ",character (string),
14/N,status,"Tree status: alive or dead. Dead trees from previous censuses are removed. Any tree that has a ""dead"" qualifier here was recorded as dead in the current year",character (string),
15/O,location,"Indicates ""North"" or ""South"" to give general region of plot. Determined from maps in ""clean_data_files"" folder",character (string),

19/S,treeID,"Arbitrary numeric identifier for trees, identical to those used in the main plot database and useful for matching dendrometers to the plot data",numeric (integer),
20/T,date,"Date as integer number of days since 1 Jan 1961, for easy calculation of time between measurements",numeric (integer),
21/U,dendDiam,"Trunk diameter at the dendrometer, measured by a diameter tape, taken when dendrometer is first installed and necessary for converting subsequent dendrometer measures to dbh",numeric (double),

23/W,newband,"Quantifier for whether or not the dendroband was changed. Enter 1 if changed, 0 if not.",numeric (integer),
24/X,dendroID,"Arbitrary, unique numeric identifier for dendrometer, crucial for identifying when dendrometers change within a stem. When a dendroband is replaced or moved to a different POM (point of measurement), a new dendroID is given following in numerical order (across all years). This column contains the most recent dendroID number for the year. See dendroID_chronology.csv for previous dendroIDs.",numeric (integer),
